description: "Dwarf-shaped and industrious, the magmin are among the deepest-dwellers\
  \ of Dungeon World. Found in cities of brass and obsidian built nearest\
  \ the molten core of the planet, the magmin live a life devoted to craft\u2014\
  especially that of fire and magical items related to it. Surly and strange,\
  \ they do not often deign to speak to petitioners who appear at their\
  \ gates, even those who have somehow found a way to survive the hellish\
  \ heat. Even so, they respect little more than a finely made item and\
  \ to learn to forge from a magmin craftsman means unlocking secrets unknown\
  \ to surface blacksmiths. Like so much else, visiting the magmin is a\
  \ game of risk and reward."
