description: "Some elementals are conjured up in sacred circles etched in\
  \ chalk. Most, in fact. There\u2019s a sort of science to it. Others,\
  \ though, aren\u2019t so orderly\u2014they don\u2019t fall under the carefully\
  \ controlled assignments of fire, air, water, or earth. Some are a natural\
  \ confluence of vine and mire and fungus. They do not think the way a\
  \ man might think. They cannot be understood as one might understand an\
  \ elf. They simply are. Spirits of the swamp. Shamblers in the mud."
