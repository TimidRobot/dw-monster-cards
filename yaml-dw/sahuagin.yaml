description: The shape and craft of men wedded to the hunger and the endless
  teeth of a shark. Voracious and filled only with hate, these creatures
  will not stop until all life has been consumed. They cannot be reasoned
  with, they cannot be controlled or sated. They are hunger and bloodlust,
  driven up from the depths of the sea to ravage coastal towns and swallow
  island villages.
