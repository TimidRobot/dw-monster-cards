description: "\u201CSo was it written that the heavens opened up to Avra\u2019\
  hal and did an angel from the clouds emerge to speak unto her and so did\
  \ it appear to her as her firstborn daughter\u2014beautiful, of ebon skin\
  \ and golden eyes\u2014and did Avra\u2019hal weep to see it. \u2018Be\
  \ not afraid,\u2019 it commanded her. \u2018Go to the villages I have\
  \ shown you in your dreams and unto them show the word I have written\
  \ on your soul.\u2019 Avra\u2019hal wept and wept and did agree to do\
  \ this and did take up her sword and tome and did into the villages go,\
  \ a great thirst for blood on her lips for the word the angel wrote upon\
  \ the soul of Avra\u2019hal was \u2018kill\u2019.\u201D"
