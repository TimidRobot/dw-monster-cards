description: "In the Nordemark, the men and women tell tales in their wooden\
  \ halls of a place where the noble dead go. A mead hall atop their heavenly\
  \ mountain where men of valor go to await the final battle for the world.\
  \ It is a goodly place. It is a place where one hopes to go after death.\
  \ And the inglorious dead? Those who fall to poison or in an act of cowardice,\
  \ warriors though they may be? Well, those mead halls aren\u2019t open\
  \ to all and sundry. Some come back, frozen and twisted and empowered\
  \ by jealous rage and wage their eternal war not on the forces of giants\
  \ or trolls but on the towns of the men they once knew."
