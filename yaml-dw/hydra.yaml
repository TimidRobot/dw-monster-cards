description: "A bit like a dragon, wingless though it may be. Heads, nine\
  \ in number at birth, spring from a muscled trunk and weave a sinuous\
  \ pattern in the air. A hydra is to be feared\u2014a scaled terror of\
  \ the marsh. The older ones, though, they have more heads, for every failed\
  \ attempt to murder it just makes it stronger. Cut off a head and two\
  \ more grow in its place. Only a strike, true and strong, to the heart\
  \ can end a hydra\u2019s life. Not time or tide or any other thing but\
  \ this."
