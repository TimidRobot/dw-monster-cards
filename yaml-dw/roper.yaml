description: "Evolutionary happenstance has created a clever underground\
  \ predator. Disguised as a rocky formation\u2014most often a stalactite\
  \ or stalagmite\u2014the roper waits for its prey to wander by. When it\
  \ does, whether it\u2019s a rat, a goblin or a foolhardy adventurer, a\
  \ mass of thin, whipping tentacles erupts from the thing\u2019s hide.\
  \ A hundred lashes in the blink of an eye and the stunned prey is being\
  \ dragged into the roper\u2019s mouth. Surprisingly effective for a thing\
  \ that looks like a rock."
