description: 'Mystical sorcerers debate: is this creature truly undead or
  is it a golem made of a particularly rare and blasphemous material? The
  bones, sinews and scales of a dead dragon make up this bleak automaton.
  Winged but flightless, dragon-shaped but without the mighty fire of such
  a noble thing, the dragonbone serves its master with a twisted devotion
  and is often set to assault the keeps and towers of rival necromancers.
  It would take a being of some considerable evil to twist the remains of
  a dragon thus.'
