description: "Desperation is the watchword of banditry. When times are tough,\
  \ what else is there to do but scavenge a weapon and take up with a clan\
  \ of nasty men and women? Highway robbery, poaching, scams and cons and\
  \ murder most foul but we\u2019ve all got to eat so who can blame them?\
  \ Then again, there\u2019s evil in the hearts of some and who\u2019s to\
  \ say that desperation isn\u2019t a need  to sate one\u2019s baser lusts?\
  \ Anyway\u2014it\u2019s this or starve, sometimes."
