description: 'At the heart of every hive, no matter its size or kind, lives
  a queen. As large as any giant, she sits protected by her guard, served
  by every drone and taskmaster with her own, singular purpose: to spread
  her kind and grow the hive. To birth the eggs. To nurture. We do not understand
  the minds of these creatures but it is known they can communicate with
  their children, somehow, over vast distances and that they begin to teach
  them the ways of earth and stone and war while still pale and wriggling
  larvae, without a word. To kill one is to set chaos on the hive; without
  their queen, the rest turn on one another in a mad, blind rage.'
