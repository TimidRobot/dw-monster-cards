description: "Tall. Real tall. Eight or nine feet when they\u2019re young\
  \ or weak. Covered all over in warty, tough skin, too. Big teeth, stringy\
  \ hair like swamp moss and long, dirty nails. Some are green, some gray,\
  \ some black. They\u2019re clannish and hateful of each other, not to\
  \ mention all the rest of us. Near impossible to kill, too, unless you\u2019\
  ve fire or acid to spare\u2014cut a limb off and watch. In a few days,\
  \ you\u2019ve got two trolls where you once had one. A real serious problem,\
  \ as you can imagine."
