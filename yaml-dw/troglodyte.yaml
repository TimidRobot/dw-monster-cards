description: "Long-forgotten, our last remaining ancestors dwell in caves\
  \ in the wild parts of the world. Driven away by our cities and villages,\
  \ our iron swords and our fire, these ape-men eat their meat raw with\
  \ sharp-nailed hands and jagged teeth. They strike out at frontier villages\
  \ wielding clubs and in overwhelming numbers to seize cattle, tools, and\
  \ poor prisoners to drag into the hills. Known for their viciousness and\
  \ their stink, they\u2019re an old and dying race we\u2019d all sooner\
  \ forget existed."
