description: "Now you see it, now you don\u2019t. Hounds once owned by a\
  \ sorcerer lord and imbued with a kind of illusory cloak, they escaped\
  \ into the woods around his lair and began to breed with wolves and wild\
  \ dogs of the forest. You can spot them, if you\u2019re lucky, by the\
  \ glittering silver of their coats and their strange, ululating howls.\
  \ They have a remarkable talent for being not quite where they appear\
  \ to be and use it to take down prey much stronger than themselves. If\
  \ you find yourself facing a pack of blink dogs you might as well close\
  \ your eyes and fight. You\u2019ll have an easier time when not betrayed\
  \ by your natural sight. By such sorceries are the natural places of the\
  \ world polluted with unnatural things."
