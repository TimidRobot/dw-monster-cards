description: "Come away from an encounter with one of these vengeful spirits\
  \ merely deaf and count yourself lucky for the rest of your peaceful,\
  \ silent days. Often mistaken at first glance for a ghost or wandering\
  \ spirit, the banshee reveals a far more deadly talent for sonic assault\
  \ when angered. And her anger comes easy. A victim of betrayal (often\
  \ by a loved one) the banshee makes known her displeasure with a roar\
  \ or scream that can putrefy flesh and rend the senses. If you can help\
  \ her get her vengeance, they say she might grant rewards. Whether the\
  \ affection of a spurned spirit is a thing you\u2019d want, well, that\u2019\
  s another question."
