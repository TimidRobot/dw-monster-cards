description: "\u201CIt will be a gathering of clans unseen in this age.\
  \ Call Stormhoof and Brightspear. Summon Whitemane and Ironflanks. Sound\
  \ the horn and we shall begin our meeting\u2014we shall speak the words\
  \ and bind our people together. Too long have the men cut the ancient\
  \ trees for their ships. The elves are weak and cowardly, friend to these\
  \ mannish slime. It will be a cleansing fire from the darkest woods. Raise\
  \ the red banner of war! Today we strike back against these apes and retake\
  \ what is ours!\u201D"
