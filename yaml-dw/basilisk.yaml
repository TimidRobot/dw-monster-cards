description: "\u201CFew have seen a basilisk and lived to tell the tale.\
  \ Get it? Seen a basilisk? Little bit of basilisk humor there. Sorry,\
  \ I know you\u2019re looking for something helpful, sirs. Serious stuff,\
  \ I understand. The basilisk, even without its ability to turn your flesh\
  \ to stone with a gaze, is a dangerous creature. A bit like a frog, bulbous\
  \ eyes and six muscled legs built for leaping. A bit like an alligator,\
  \ with snapping jaws and sawing teeth. Covered in stony scales and very\
  \ hard to kill. Best avoided, if possible.\u201D"
