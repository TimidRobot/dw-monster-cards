description: "For a commoner with a strong arm, sometimes it\u2019s this\
  \ or be a bandit. It\u2019s wear the colors and don ill-fitting armor\
  \ and march into the unknown with a thousand other scared men and women\
  \ conscripted to fight the wars of our time. They could be hiding out\
  \ in the woods instead, living off poached elk and dodging the king\u2019\
  s guard. Better to risk one\u2019s life in service to a cause. To bravely\
  \ toss one\u2019s lot in with one\u2019s fellows and hope to come out\
  \ the other side still in one piece. Besides, the nobles need strong men\
  \ and women. What is it they say? A handful of soldiers beats a mouthful\
  \ of arguments."
