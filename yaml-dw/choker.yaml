description: "Some say these things descended from the family of a cruel\
  \ wizard who forced them to live out their lives underground. They say\
  \ his experiments led him to fear the sun and ages passed while he descended\
  \ into unlife, dragging his folk along with him. These things resemble\
  \ men, in a way. Head, four limbs and all that. Only their skin is wet\
  \ and rubbery and their arms long and fingers grasping. They hate all\
  \ life that bears the stink of the sun\u2019s touch, as one might expect.\
  \ Jealousy, long-instilled, is hard to shake."
