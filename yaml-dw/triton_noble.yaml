description: "The triton ruling houses were chosen, they say, at the dawn\
  \ of time. Granted lordship over all the races of the sea by some now-forgotten\
  \ god. These bloodlines continue, passing rulership from father to daughter\
  \ and mother to son through the ages. Each is allowed to rule their city\
  \ in whatever way they choose\u2014some alone or with their spouses, others\
  \ in council of brothers and sisters. In ages past, they were known for\
  \ their sagacity and bloodlines of even-temper were respected above all\
  \ else. The tidecallers prophecy is changing that: nobles are expected\
  \ to be strong, not wise. The nobles have begun to respond, and it is\
  \ feared by some that the ancient blood is changing forever. It may be\
  \ too late to turn back. Time and tide wait for none."
