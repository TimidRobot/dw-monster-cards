description: "The pounding of the jungle drums calls to it. The slab of\
  \ meat on the sacrificial stone to lure in the great ape. Girallon, they\
  \ call it\u2014a name from the long-forgotten tongue of the kings who\
  \ bred the beast. Taller than a building, some say. Cloaked in ivory fur\
  \ with tusks as long as scimitars. Four arms? Six? The rumors are hard\
  \ to verify. Every year it is the same: some explorer visits the jungle\
  \ villages seeking the ape and returns, never quite the same, never with\
  \ a trophy. The pounding of the drums goes on."
