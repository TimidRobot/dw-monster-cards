description: "Their natural form, if you ever see it, is hideous. Like a\
  \ creature who stopped growing part-way, before it decided it was elf\
  \ or man or dwarf. Then again, maybe that\u2019s how you get to be the\
  \ way a doppelg\xE4nger is\u2014without form, without shape to call their\
  \ own, maybe all they really seek is a place to fit in. If you go out\
  \ into the world, when you come back home, make sure your friends are\
  \ who you think they are. They might, instead, be a doppelg\xE4nger and\
  \ your friend might be dead at the bottom of a well somewhere. Then again,\
  \ depending on your friends, that might be an improvement."
