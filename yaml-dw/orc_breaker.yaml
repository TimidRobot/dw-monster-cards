description: "\u201CBefore you set out across the hordeland, brave sir,\
  \ hark a moment to the tale of Sir Regnus. Regnus was like you, sir\u2014\
  a paladin of the Order, all a-shine in his plated armor and with a shield\
  \ as tall as a man. Proud he was of it, too\u2014Mirrorshield, he called\
  \ himself. Tale goes that he\u2019d set his eyes on rescuing some lost\
  \ priest, a kidnap from the abbey on the borders. Regnus came across some\
  \ orcs in his travels, a dozen or so, and thought, as one might, that\
  \ they\u2019d be no match. Battle was joined and all was well until one\
  \ of them orcs emerged from the fray with a hammer bigger than any man\
  \ ought to be able to wield. Built more like an ogre or a troll, they\
  \ say it was, and with a single swing, it crushed Regnus to the ground,\
  \ shield and all. It were no ordinary orc, they say. It were a breaker.\
  \ They can\u2019t make plate of their own, see, so maybe it\u2019s jealousy\
  \ drives these burly things to crush and shatter the way they do. Effective\
  \ tactic, though. Careful out there.\u201D"
