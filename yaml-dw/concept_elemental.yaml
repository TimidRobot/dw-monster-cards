description: "The planes are not as literal as our world. Clothed in the\
  \ elemental chaos are places of stranger stuff than air and water. Here,\
  \ rivers of time crash upon shores of crystal fear. Bleak storms of nightmare\
  \ roil and churn in a laughter-bright sky. Sometimes, the spirits of these\
  \ places can be lured into our world, though they are infinitely more\
  \ unpredictable and strange than mere fire or earth might be. Easier to\
  \ make mistakes, too\u2014one might try calling up a wealth elemental\
  \ and be surprised to find a murder elemental instead."
