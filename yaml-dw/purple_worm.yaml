description: "I\xE4! I\xE4! The Purple Worm! Blessed is its holy slime!\
  \ We walk, unworthy, in its miles of massive tunnels. We are but shadows\
  \ under its violet and all-consuming glory. Mere acolytes, we who hope\
  \ someday to return to the great embrace of its tooth-ringed maw. Let\
  \ it consume us! Let it eat our homes and villages so that we might be\
  \ taken! I\xE4! I\xE4! The Purple Worm!"
