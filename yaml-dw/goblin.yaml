description: "Nobody seems to know where these things came from. Elves say\
  \ they\u2019re the dwarves\u2019 fault\u2014dredged up from a hidden place\
  \ beneath the earth. Dwarves say they\u2019re bad elvish children, taken\
  \ away at birth and raised in the dark. The truth of the matter is that\
  \ goblins have always been here and they\u2019ll be here once all the\
  \ civilized races have fallen and gone away. Goblins never die out. There\u2019\
  s just too damn many of them."
