description: "You never get away with murder. Not really. You might evade\
  \ the law, might escape your own conscience in the end and die, fat and\
  \ happy in a mansion somewhere. When the gods themselves notice your misdeeds,\
  \ though, that\u2019s where your luck runs out and a mohrg is born. The\
  \ mohrg is a skeleton\u2014flesh and skin and hair all rotted away. All\
  \ but their guts\u2014their twisted, knotted guts still spill from their\
  \ bellies, magically preserved and often wrapped, noose-like, about their\
  \ necks. They do not think, exactly, but they suffer. They kill and wreak\
  \ havoc and their souls do not rest. Such is the punishment, both on them\
  \ for the crime and on all mankind for daring to murder one another. The\
  \ gods are just and they are harsh."
