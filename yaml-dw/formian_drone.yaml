description: "With good cause, they say that these creatures (like all insects,\
  \ really) are claimed by the powers of Law. They are order made flesh\u2014\
  a perfectly stratified society in which every larva, hatchling and adult\
  \ knows its place in the great hive. The formian is some strange intersection\
  \ of men and ants. (Though there are winged tribes that look like wasps\
  \ out in the Western Desert, I\u2019ve heard. And some with great sawtooth\
  \ arms like mantids in the forests of the east.) Tall, with a hard shell\
  \ and a harder mind, these particular formians are the bottom caste. They\
  \ work the hills and honeycombs with single-minded joy that can be known\
  \ only by such an alien mind."
