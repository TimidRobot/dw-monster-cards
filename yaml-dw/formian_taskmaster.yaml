description: "It takes two hands to rule an empire: one to wield the scepter\
  \ and one to crack the whip. These ant-folk are that whip. Lucky for them,\
  \ with two extra arms, that\u2019s a lot of whip to crack. They oversee\
  \ the vast swarms of worker drones that set to build the mighty caverns\
  \ and ziggurats that dot the places that formians can be found. One in\
  \ a hundred, these brutes stand two or three feet taller than their pale,\
  \ near-mindless kin and have a sharper, crueler wit to match. They\u2019\
  ll often ignore the soft races (as we\u2019re known) if we don\u2019t\
  \ interfere in a project, but get in the way of The Great Work and expect\
  \ nothing less than their full attention. You don\u2019t want their full\
  \ attention."
