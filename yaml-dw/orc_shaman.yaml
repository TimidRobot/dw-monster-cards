description: The orcs are as old a race as any. They cast bones in the dirt
  and called to the gods in the trees and stone as the elves built their
  first cities. They have waged wars, conquered kingdoms, and fallen into
  corruption in the aeons it took for men to crawl from their caves and
  dwarves to first see the light of the sun. Fitting, then, that the old
  ways still hold. They summon the powers of the world to work, to fight
  and to protect their people, as they have since the first nights.
