description: "\u201DAs with all things they undertake, the elves approach\
  \ war as an art. I saw them fight, once. The Battle of Astrid\u2019s Veil.\
  \ Yes, I am that old, boy, now hush. A warrior-maiden, she was clad in\
  \ plate that shone like the winter sky. White hair streaming and a pennant\
  \ of ocean blue tied to her spear. She seemed to glide between the trees\
  \ the way an angel might, striking out and bathing her blade in blood\
  \ that steamed in the cold air. I never felt so small before. I trained\
  \ with the master-at-arms of Battlemoore, you know. I\u2019ve held a sword\
  \ longer than you\u2019ve been alive, boy, and in that one moment I knew\
  \ that my skill meant nothing. Thank the gods the elves were with us then.\
  \ A more beautiful and terrible thing I have never seen.\u201D"
