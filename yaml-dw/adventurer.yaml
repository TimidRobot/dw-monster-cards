description: "\u201CScum of the earth, they are. A troupe of armored men\
  \ and women come sauntering into town, brandishing what, for all intents\
  \ and purposes, is enough magical and mundane power to level the whole\
  \ place. Bringing with them bags and bags of loot, still dripping blood\
  \ from whatever poor sod they had to kill to get it. An economical fiasco\
  \ waiting to happen, if you ask me. The whole system becomes completely\
  \ uprooted. Dangerous, unpredictable murder-hobos. Oh, wait, you\u2019\
  re an adventurer? I take it all back.\u201D"
