description: "<i>Scarabaeus pyractomena</i>! What a delightful creature\u2014\
  see how its carapace glitters in the light of our torches? Not too close\
  \ now, they\u2019re temperamental, you see. The fire in their belly isn\u2019\
  t just metaphorical, no. Watch as I goad the beast. Aha! A spout of flame!\
  \ Unexpected, isn\u2019t it? One of these creatures alone, if it comes\
  \ up from below, can be a hellish nuisance to a farmstead or village.\
  \ A whole swarm? There\u2019s a reason they call it a conflagration of\
  \ fire beetles. "
