description: "They dwell beneath the earth because they do not belong above\
  \ it any longer. An undying race of mighty titans fled the plains and\
  \ mountains in ages past\u2014driven out by men and their heroes. Left\
  \ to bide their time in the dark, hate and anger warmed by the pools of\
  \ lava deep below. It\u2019s said that an earthquake is a goliath\u2019\
  s birthing cry. Someday they\u2019ll take back what\u2019s theirs."
