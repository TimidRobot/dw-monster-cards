description: "Hunger. Hunger hunger hunger. Desperate clinging void-stomach-emptiness\
  \ hunger. Sharp talons to rend flesh and teeth to tear and crack bones\
  \ and suck out the soft marrow inside. Vomit up hate and screaming jealous\
  \ anger and charge on twisted legs\u2014scare the living flesh and sweeten\
  \ it ever more with the stink of fear. Feast. Peasant or knight, wizard,\
  \ sage, prince, or priest all make for such delicious meat."
