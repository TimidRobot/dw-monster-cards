description: "Our shaman says that all the things of the world have a spirit.\
  \ Stones, trees, a stream. Now that I\u2019ve seen the earth roil under\
  \ my feet and fists of stone beat my friends half to death I\u2019d like\
  \ to believe that crazy old man. The one I saw was huge\u2014big as a\
  \ house! It came boiling up from a rockslide out of nowhere and had a\
  \ voice like an avalanche. I pay my respects, now. Rightly so."
