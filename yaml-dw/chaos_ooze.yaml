description: "The barrier between Dungeon World and the elemental planes\
  \ is not, as you might hope, a wall of stone. It\u2019s much more porous.\
  \ Places where the civil races do not often tread can sometimes, how to\
  \ put this, spring a leak. Like a dam come just a little loose. Bits and\
  \ pieces of the chaos spill out. Sometimes, they\u2019ll congeal like\
  \ an egg on a pan\u2014that\u2019s where we get the material for many\
  \ of the Guild\u2019s magical trinkets. Useful, right? Sometimes, though,\
  \ it squirms and squishes around a bit and stays that way, warping all\
  \ it touches into some other, strange form. Chaos begets chaos, and it\
  \ grows."
