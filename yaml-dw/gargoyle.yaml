description: "It\u2019s a sad thing, really. Guardians bred by magi of the\
  \ past with no more castles to guard. Their ancestors\u2019 sacred task\
  \ bred into their blood leads them to find a place\u2014ruins mostly,\
  \ but sometimes a cave or hill or mountain cliff\u2014and guard it as\
  \ though their masters yet lived below. They\u2019re notoriously good\
  \ at finding valuables buried below the earth, though. Find one of these\
  \ winged reptiles and you\u2019ll find yourself a treasure nearby. Just\
  \ be careful, they\u2019re hard to spot and tend to move in packs."
