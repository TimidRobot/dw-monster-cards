description: "There are cultures who revere the dead. They do not bury them\
  \ in the cold earth and mourn their passing. These people spend weeks\
  \ preparing the sacred corpse for its eternal rest. Temples, pyramids,\
  \ and great vaults of stone are built to house them and are populated\
  \ with slaves, pets and gold. The better to live in luxury beyond the\
  \ Black Gates, no? Do not be tempted by these vaults\u2014oh, I know that\
  \ greedy look! Heed my warnings or risk a terrible fate, for the honored\
  \ dead do not wish to be disturbed. Thievery will only raise their ire\u2014\
  don\u2019t say I did not warn you!"
