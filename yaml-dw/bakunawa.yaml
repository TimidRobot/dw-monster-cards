description: "Dragon-Turtle\u2019s sister is a mighty serpent queen. Ten\
  \ yards of scales and muscle, they say she wakes with a hunger when the\
  \ sun disappears from the sky. She is attracted by bright light in the\
  \ darkness and like any snake, the Bakunawa is sneaky. She will seek first\
  \ to beguile and mislead and will only strike out with violence when no\
  \ other option is available. When she does, though, her jaws are strong\
  \ enough to crack the hull of any swamp-boat and certainly enough to slice\
  \ through a steel breastplate or two. Give the greedy snake your treasures\
  \ and she might just leave you alone."
