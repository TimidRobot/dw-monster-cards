description: "The orcish horde is a savage, bloodthirsty, and hateful collection\
  \ of tribes. There are myths and stories that tell of the origin of their\
  \ rage\u2014a demon curse, a homeland destroyed, elven magic gone wrong\u2014\
  but the truth has been lost to time. Every able orc, be it man or woman,\
  \ child or elder, swears fealty to the warchief and their tribe and bears\
  \ the jagged blade of a bloodwarrior. Men are trained to fight and kill\u2014\
  orcs are born to it."
