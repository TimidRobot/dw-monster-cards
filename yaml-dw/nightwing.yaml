description: "Scholars of the necromantic arts will tell you that the appellation\
  \ \u201Cundead\u201D applies not only to those who have lived, died, and\
  \ been returned to a sort of partway living state. It is the proper name\
  \ of any creature whose energy originates beyond the Black Gates. The\
  \ creature men call the nightwing is one such\u2014empowered by the negative\
  \ light of Death\u2019s domain. Taking the shape of massive, shadowy,\
  \ winged creatures (some more bat-like, some like vultures, others like\
  \ some ancient, leathery things) nightwings travel in predatory flocks,\
  \ swooping down to strip the flesh from cattle, horses and unlucky peasants\
  \ out past curfew. Watch the night sky for their red eyes. Listen for\
  \ their screeching call. And hope to the gods you have something to hide\
  \ under until they pass."
