description: "Every culture tells the story the same way. You live, you\
  \ love or you hate, you win or you lose, you die somehow you\u2019re not\
  \ too fond of and here you are, ghostly and full of disappointment and\
  \ what have you. Some people take it upon themselves, brave and kindly\
  \ folks, to seek out the dead and help them pass to their rightful rest.\
  \ You can find them, most times, down at the tavern drinking away the\
  \ terrors they\u2019ve seen or babbling to themselves in the madhouse.\
  \ Death takes a toll on the living, no matter how you come by it."
