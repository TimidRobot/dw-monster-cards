description: "It\u2019s typical to think that all the malignant arcane monsters\
  \ made in this world are birthed by wizards, sorcerers, and their ilk.\
  \ That the colleges and towers of Dungeon World are womb to every bleak\
  \ experiment. There are mistakes made in the depths of the earth, too.\
  \ These ones, the derro, are the mistakes of a long-forgotten dwarven\
  \ alchemist. The derro don\u2019t forget, though. Twisted and hateful,\
  \ the derro can be spotted by their swollen skulls, brain-matter grown\
  \ too large. They do not speak except in thoughts to one another and plot\
  \ in the silent dark to extract sweetest revenge\u2014that of the created\
  \ on the creator."
