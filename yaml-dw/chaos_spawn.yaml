description: Driven from the city, a cultist finds sanctuary in towns and
  villages. Discovered there, he flees to the hills and scratches his devotion
  on the cave walls. Found out again, he is chased with knife and torch
  into the depths, crawling deeper and deeper until, in the deepest places,
  he loses his way. First, he forgets his name. Then he forgets his shape.
  His chaos gods, most beloved, bless him with a new one.
