description: "How many adventurers\u2019 last thoughts were \u201Cstrange,\
  \ this tunnel seems cleaner than most?\u201D Too many, and all because\
  \ of this transparent menace. A great acidic blob that expands to fill\
  \ a small chamber or corridor and then slides, ever so slowly along, eating\
  \ everything in its path. It cannot eat stone or metal and will often\
  \ have them floating in its jelly mass. Blech."
