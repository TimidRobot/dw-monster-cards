description: "Part priest, part outcast among their kind, the tidecaller\
  \ speaks with the voice of the deeps. They can be known by their mutations\u2014\
  transparent skin, perhaps, or rows of teeth like a shark. Glowing eyes\
  \ or fingertips, angler-lights in the darkness of their underwater kingdom.\
  \ They speak in a strange tongue that can call and command creatures of\
  \ the sea. They ride wild hippocampi and cast strange spells that rot\
  \ through the wooden decks of ships or encrust them with barnacles heavy\
  \ enough to sink. It is the tidecallers who come, now, back to the cities\
  \ of the triton, bearing word that the prophecy is coming to pass. The\
  \ world of men will drown in icy brine. The tidecallers speak and the\
  \ lords begin to listen."
