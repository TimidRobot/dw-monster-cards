description: "Some the size of horses. Bigger, even\u2014the kings and queens\
  \ of the eagles. Their cry pierces the mountain sky and woe to those who\
  \ fall under the shadow of their mighty wings. The ancient wizards forged\
  \ a pact with them in the primordial days. Men would take the plains and\
  \ valleys and leave the mountaintops to the eagle lords. These sacred\
  \ pacts should be honored, lest they set their talons into you. Lucky\
  \ are the elves, for the makers of their treaties yet live and when danger\
  \ comes to elvish lands, the eagle lords often serve as spies and mounts\
  \ for them. Long-lived and proud, some might be willing to trade their\
  \ ancient secrets for the right price, too."
